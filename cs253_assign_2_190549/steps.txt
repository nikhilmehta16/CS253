1. We used wget command to get the json and was saved in data.json which we converted to the desired name using mv command.
2. We set headers for the csv file.
3. First loop is on the states so that through each iteration we find the desired district for that particular state.
4. The main problem In encounteres was to pass district names as parameter for those which consisted of space, I tried a lot of ways and I finally saved these to a new file so that I don't have to pass them as arguments and read through each line with the help of while loop.
5. The further code is simple and just poses the necessary conditions that was given to us in the assignment pdf.
6. After each iteration we pass the desired district if exists to the csv file.
