file ./a to know type of something.
Compilation ToolChain--> 
Preprocessing --> cpp a.c (preprocessed file #include #define)
Substituted #define --> Compilation takes preproceesd file and turns it to assembly file -->
g++ -S a.c (produces assembly file a.s)-->
as (this is assembler) so do "as a.s -o a.0" this translated to binary code-->
Still Not Linked. -->
ld is the linker in linux system "ld a.o /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
"  or "ld a.o -lc" lc is for lib + libc lib, l for library.-->
_start instead of main because _start calls main, sir did it directly in the lecture-->


gcc -S a.c allsas a.Sas a.s -o a.ld a.0 -lc -o a.out

finally executable to decompilers a.o to a.s (disassembly)
"objdump -d a.out"

dynamically linked strip a.out now it is stripped extra info is removed metadata-->
dynamic is attached at time of process rather static is attached to binary file.
